# csc642-myindividual-project
my Bookshelf app for Individual Project 

I created my project using mysql, node.js, express, and react-native. 

The attached .mov file is a video which demonstrates the functionalities of the app. In the ScreenShot report, you can see pictures of each 
screen with a small description underneath. 

I ran into numerous problems while trying to connect my application to mybackend, tried many things and was not able to find a solution. 
It proved to be difficult to fetch data from mysql database on the ios app, I kept getting Network Request Failed and after researching, found that
iOS applications require https requests. The fetch calls currently fetch data I manually inserted in the .json file in myRESTAPIplaceholder. 

You can see in MyBookShelfScreen.js I have fetch calls implemented as well as in form.js, I handle collecting the data that is entered by the user.
