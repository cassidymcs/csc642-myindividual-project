# csc642-myindividual-project
my app for individual project 


I created my project using mysql, node.js, express, and react-native. 

The Video is the attached .mov file which demonstrates the functionalities of the app. In The ScreenShot Report, you can see pictures of each 
screen with a small description underneath. 

I ran into numerous problems while trying to connect my application to mybackend, tried many things and was not able to find a solution. 
It proved to be difficult to fetch data from mysql database on the ios app, I kept getting Network Request Failed and after researching a whole bunch, found that
ios applications require https requests which I was not able to gfigure out how to create certificates for using mysqlworkbench. 

Either way you can see in MyBookShelfScreen.js I have implemented fetch calls as well as in form.js I handle collecting the data that is entered by the user. I am hoping 
for as much credit as I can earn. Thanks.
